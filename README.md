Prime-number theory based RSA encryption algorithm

This is a RSA encryption and decryption program written in Python. It is an implementation of the RSA algorithm. 
The program generates a public and private key pair, encrypts a message using the public key, and decrypts the message using the private key. 
It also includes a function to generate a random prime number.
